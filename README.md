# todo-list

This is a handy to-do app. This app allows the user to create to-do lists with different priority levels. The user can also create separate projects
to group certain to-do lists. The app makes use of the user's local storage to save their entries and bring them back when they refresh, or close
and reload. The purpose of this project was to practice OOP principles, and also continue practicing with dynamically constructing objects, DOM
manipulation, CSS styling, and HTML setup.
